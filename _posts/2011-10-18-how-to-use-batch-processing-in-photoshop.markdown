Batch processing, used along with actions, is a tool that can apply a single set of instructions to multiple images or even a complete folder. I recently wrote about [how to use actions in Photoshop](http://benholland.me/photoshop/how-to-use-actions-in-photoshop/) and this tutorial is linked with that so go ahead and read it first. We are going to learn how to apply an action to a folder full of images or all of your opened files. Here's how.

### Step 1 - Create an action
Make sure you have an action saved. If you don't know how to do it then [click here to see how](http://benholland.me/photoshop/how-to-use-actions-in-photoshop/).

### Step 2 - Setup A Batch Process
Setting up a batch process is easy. Go to _File -&gt; Automate -&gt; Batch._  A new window will pop up. This is where we alter the settings.

1 + 2 - Locate the action you wish to use3 - Select the source. These are your images you want to apply the action to. The two options you will mostly use are _Folder_ and _Opened Files_.4 - Select the destination. This can vary depending on your action. In most of my actions, I will record saving and closing the file, so I leave this option at none. If you have not done this, then you can select _Save and Close_ or_ Folder._ This allows you to select a different destination and rename the files if you wish.

And that's it, just hit OK. Very simple really and can save a bunch of time with simple tasks such as; converting a holiday album to black and white, resizing images for the web or adding a border to each image.
