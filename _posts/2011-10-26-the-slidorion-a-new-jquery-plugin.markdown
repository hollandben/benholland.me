The [Slidorion</a> is a great new jQuery plugin built to combine an image slider and an accordion. Accompanied by a range of features and effects, the <a title="Slidorion, A jQuery Plugin" href="http://www.slidorion.com" target="_blank">Slidorion</a> a fantastic and slick plugin. There are lot of image sliders out there, but nothing that provides the user with enough space to write a description about that image, whether it be a new product or a holiday home in Spain. The <a title="Slidorion, A jQuery Plugin" href="http://www.slidorion.com" target="_blank">Slidorion](http://www.slidorion.com) gives you that freedom and also allows you to insert links into the description of that image.
