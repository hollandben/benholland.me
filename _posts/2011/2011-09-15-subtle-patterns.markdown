Subtle patterns hosts a fantastic collection of high quality design patterns for FREE!! Ranging from cardboard to silver scales to carbon fibre, if you're in need of a subtle texture to sit in the background on your new website, my bet is that you'll find it [here](http://www.subtlepatterns.com/).

The site also has a download section containing a volume of patterns, some wallpapers and even a lovely WordPress plugin. And for all you designers out there, why not submit a pattern you've made and share with thousands of users.

All textures tile for super easy use, so why not check the collection out before you start your next project.

Definitely worth a bookmark!
