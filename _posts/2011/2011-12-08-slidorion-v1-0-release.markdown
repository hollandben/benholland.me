If you haven't heard about [Slidorion</a> then where have you been?!? Check it out now!! It's a <a href="http://www.slidorion.com">jQuery plugin](http://www.slidorion.com) that combines a slider with an accordion to create some beautiful effects. Recently released as v1.0, there's been some vital upgrades that make it even better.

Slidorion now allows for embedded HTML, meaning you can basically put whatever you want into it, giving you all the customisation you could want. Some new effects have also been added. There are 3 different random settings; slide random, overlap random and random. They do what they say, but combined with improved performance and a series of bug fixes, Slidorion can do more things and do them better.

Another large improvement has been to the structure of Slidorion. The complicated setup has been scrapped so there is a simple process to setting it up.

So check out Slidorion v1.0 and let me know what you think...

**Edit:** [Slidorion is now available for WordPress](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/slidorion/)
