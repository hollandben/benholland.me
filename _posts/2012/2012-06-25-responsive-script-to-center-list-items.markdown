I was recently assigned the task of creating a webpage with some list items that we're centered within a container. Easy enough to do, just create a row of list items and set the margin to auto so it will always be in the center. Turns out, not so simple. I was asked to make the list items responsive, so when the page was made smaller, the list items reshuffled themselves and become centered again.

The result of this was [a responsive script that centers list items](http://labs.benholland.me/centering/") when the page is resized. You can download the script from the demo or download this zip file which has the example included.
