            <p>I ran into a small bug with the commenting system <a href="http://www.disqus.com,%20Disqus">Disqus</a> today. After migrating all my posts from WordPress to Disqus, I noticed that comments weren&#39;t appearing on some blog posts. With some further investigation, it turned out that my WordPress URLs all had a trailing slash at the end, whereas in the new build of my site, they don&#39;t. This meant that the URLs I was serving visitors and those that were in the system didn&#39;t match.</p>

            <p>I was recently assigned the task of creating a webpage with some list items that we&#39;re centered within a container. Easy enough to do, just create a row of list items and set the margin to auto so it will always be in the center. Turns out, not so simple. I was asked to make the list items responsive, so when the page was made smaller, the list items reshuffled themselves and become centered again. The result of this was <a href="http://benholland.me/labs/centering/,%20a%20responsive%20script%20that%20centers%20list%20items%3C/a%3E%20when%20the%20page%20is%20resized.You%20can%20download%20the%20script%20from%20the%20%3Ca%20title=%22A%20Responsive%20Script%20That%20Centers%20List%20Items%22%20href=%22http://benholland.me/labs/centering/%22%20target=%22_blank%22%3Edemo%3C/a%3E%20or%20%3Ca%20title=%22Download%20Zip%22%20href=%22labs/centering/centerItems.zip%22%20target=%22_blank%22%3Edownload%20this%20zip%20file">a responsive script that centers list items</a> when the page is resized.You can download the script from the <a title="A Responsive Script That Centers List Items" href="http://benholland.me/labs/centering/" target="_blank">demo</a> or <a title="Download Zip" href="labs/centering/centerItems.zip" target="_blank">download this zip file</a> which has the example included.</p>

            <p>When I login to this or any other WordPress blog, I am always greeted with the same boring and useless widgets. Ok some aren&#39;t useless. Recent drafts and recent comments are useful and at a push the &#39;Right Now&#39; widget, but that is rarely used. So I asked myself, what would I like on the homepage? Well I find myself from time to time having to go back into the admin area to amend a spelling mistake that I missed before publishing a post. So creating a &quot;Latest Posts&quot; widget that displays the most current posts would be a good place to start. Adding widgets in WordPress is really simple. Here&#39;s how...</p>

It was pretty hard! Having to take something from a simple idea to a finished product in that time frame is tough, but there&#39;s something about being under the pressure of a short time frame that made it work. I didn&#39;t have time to worry if this colour was correct, or if that padding needed to be an extra pixel. It all comes down to, does it work? So here is what I came up with...</p>
