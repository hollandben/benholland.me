    <div class="post__body">
        <p>I encountered a very peculiar problem today, where all my JavaScript was being printed to the page whilst still running in the browser. I was quite sure what caused this so I did some investigating (slowly undoing all my changes to see what caused it. really basic I know!!) and finally found the problem was with a CSS change I had made.</p>

<p>Whilst adding some global styles using the <code>*</code> operator, I had added the code <code>display: block</code> to it. Turns out that this tells all HTML tags, <code>script</code> included, to display as a block element. Quite an interesting discovery really, and is a great way of easily printing out code, whether it be development purposes or simple for blog like this very one.</p>

<!--- extract -->

<p>So to just target the script tags, then use this CSS code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">script {
    display: block;
    white-space: pre;
 }
</code></pre></div>
<p>Adding the &quot;white-space: pre;&quot; will preserve the line breaks exactly as they are in the code.</p>
