I think this is a really cool idea, and although half of the reworked skins are poor, the other half are really cool. There&#39;s a limited amount you can do when you&#39;re not able to re-structure any of the code, but I managed to work this out...</p><p><img src="/assets/2012/02/minimal-facebook-layout.jpg" alt=""></p><p>I&#39;ve messed about with changing styles to websites before, but as soon as I saw that there was a site which allowed users to share their skins, I was determined to make my own. I chose Facebook as there are lots of little things on there that annoy me. For instance, the left columns contains groups I&#39;m in and list&#39;s I have created. I don&#39;t use these so I&#39;ve decided the hide most of them and only show when the user hovers.</p><p>You can install the theme for Facebook from here. Comment and rate if you like it.</p><p><a href="http://stylebot.me/styles/1119,%20Stylebot%20-%20Facebook%20Redesign">Stylebot - Facebook Redesign</a></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> To uninstall, go to Settings &gt; Tools &gt; Extensions and uninstall from there (although I hope you won&#39;t)</p></div></div></main></body></html>
