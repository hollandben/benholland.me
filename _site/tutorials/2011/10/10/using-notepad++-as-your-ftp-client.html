        <p>For many years now, I&#39;ve been using FileZilla as my preferred choice of FTP client. For large batch uploads, there is no software better, but for making little changes to a live site or adding some extra content, FileZilla can start to frustrate. Constantly having to change windows to click &quot;Yes&quot; becomes a real annoyance, but not anymore. Not since I was introduced to Notepad++ and it&#39;s inbuilt FTP client - it makes editing files on a server so much easier. If you don&#39;t have Notepad++ installed as your default text editor then what are you doing with your life!! Go and <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/,%20download">download</a> it straight away. Then follow these simple steps to begin editing files..</p>

<h3>Step 1 - Open NppFTP Window</h3>

<p>Start by opening the NppFTP client by clicking on the icon at the end of the toolbar. Or alternatively, go to <em>Plugins -&gt; NppFTP -&gt; Show NppFTP Window</em></p>

<h3>Step 2 - Enter Profile Settings</h3>

<p>A new window will now be open. Start by clicking on the cog icon and selecting <code>Profile Settings</code>. Another window will popup asking for your FTP information. Enter your <code>hostname</code>, <code>username</code> and <code>password</code> and click <code>OK</code>.</p>

<h3>Step 3 - Connect To Your Server</h3>

<p>A new icon is now highlighted in the NppFTP window. Click on the connect icon and select which profile you want to use. In this case, I&#39;m going to select <code>visio</code>.</p>

<p>Then start editing. Everytime you save that file, Notepad++ will automatically upload it to your server with no pop-up windows or OK buttons. Although I don&#39;t recommend you use this as your way to build and develop websites, it&#39;s an excellent way of quickly changing a file on your server. Enjoy!!</p>
